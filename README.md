    - Once a valid IP address is copied, you should see the information of that IP. 

## Note üö®
 - If you use the exe file downloaded from this repository and it's showing 'null' for IP and Last Analysis Stats.
 - It means that my API usage has reached its limit. Since you're using the executable file, it contains my free VirusTotal API in it.

 - You will need to go to [VirusTotal official website](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and [Shodan offical website](https://www.shodan.io) to register and obtain an API key.
 - They are free!
